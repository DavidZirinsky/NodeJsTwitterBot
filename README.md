# NodeJS Twitter bot
This is a NodeJS twitter bot that I demoed at the Weld County High School Career Fair on 10/13/2021.

This will retweet, favorite, and comment on a user's tweet.

## Getting started:
1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access and register as many twitter accounts for api access as you'd like ( in the example image I created two).
2. Add the credentials from twitter to `main.js`
3. From the terminal run the following two commands: 
``` 
npm i
npm start
```

## Where you can go from here
To make this more realistic, each twitter bot instance could comment with a different message. Each bot could ask have a randomized delay before performing the various actions to make the activity feel more organic.
